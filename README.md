* This React application consists of a Flashcards component that renders a list of questions with their corresponding answers. The App component serves as the main entry point, rendering the Flashcards component. The questions are defined in an array with each question having an id, a question statement, and an answer. The Flashcards component manages the state of the selected question, allowing users to toggle between the question and answer by clicking on a specific card. The selected card is highlighted to provide visual feedback. The application provides a simple interactive interface for reviewing and learning JavaScript concepts.
